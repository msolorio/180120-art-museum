**_Work in Progress_**

An art museum inventory management tool using object oriented design with
JavaScript prototypes.

__Initial Challenges__

In order to fulling take advantage of an object oriented design with prototypes
I wanted the user to be able to interact directly with the data model and not just
the persistence layer (JSON file) by having the user interact with the app on a
continuously running node process.

Run the app
```
git clone git@github.com:msolorio/180120-art-museum-inventory.git
cd 180120-art-museum-inventory
npm i

node index.js
```
